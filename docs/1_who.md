# "Other people" and "use"?

## Who are these other people?

Obviously, I mean people other than yourself. You, the svelte, suave, coder-on-a-mission that's reading this. 

That said, I discovered something in the first years of my time as a professional developer, and oddly enough, it came 
from looking at an old personal project. As a result, I am very fond of the following expression:

> _**You now is a different person than you six months from now.** Looking at code you wrote six months ago is like 
> looking at pictures of you six years ago... you'll wonder "why did I do that?", "what was I thinking?", and "why did 
> I think that was okay?"!_

Whoever your user is, whether it is another person or future you, treat that person well!

## What do you mean when you say use?

My friend [Chris May](https://fosstodon.org/@_chrismay) asked me:

> _[@diji](https://mastodon.social/@diji) when you say “writing code for other people to use,” do you mean maintain

I think, whether you are **contributing** to a project, **maintaining** a project, or **using** a project; these 
suggestions apply. All code has to be read, comprehended, and modified.
